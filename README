 Icons were taken from different file managers and desktops: gentoo, xplore, dfm, nautilus, Gnome, KDE, XFCE
 and some of them were modified.

 This software uses the FOX Toolkit Library (http://www.fox-toolkit.org).
 
 
 *IMPORTANT REMARKS *
 
 1. You must use the current stable Fox version 1.6.36 (required!) or higher in the 1.6.x branch. 
 The current version of Xfe neither can be build using the Fox 1.0.x, 1.2.x, 1.4.x, nor using the 1.7.x series.
 
 2. UTF-8 is now supported, thus check that your LANG environment variable is set to be UTF-8 compliant otherwise
 accents and special characters could be wrong displayed. For composed characters to work (like ü or ê), FOX *must*
 be compiled with the --with-xim configure option. See the "Non Latin based languages" section of this README file for
 complementary informations.
  
 
 
 Description
 =-=-=-=-=-=
 
  X File Explorer (Xfe) is a lightweight file manager for X11, written using the FOX toolkit.
  It is desktop independent and can easily be customized.
  It has Commander or Explorer styles and it is very fast and small.
  Xfe is based on the popular, but discontinued X Win Commander, originally written by Maxim Baranov.



 System requirements
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Xfe is written in C++ and built using the FOX graphical toolkit library. Thereore, to build the current Xfe version,
  you need the FOX library 1.6.x installed on your system. Note that Xfe do not compile with the development version
  1.7.x of FOX!

  Xfe is known to run on Linux based systems. It should compile and run on any Unix or Unix-like system. It doesn't run
  on Windows.

 Drag and Drop operations
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Dragging a file or group or files (by moving the mouse while maintaining the left button pressed)
  to a folder or a file panel optionally opens a dialog that allows one to select the file operation: copy,
  move, link or cancel.



 Trash system
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Starting with version 1.32, Xfe implements a trash system that is fully compliant with the Freedesktop standards.
  This allows the user to move files to the trash can and to restore files from it, from within Xfe or your favorite
  desktop.
  Note that the trash files location is now: $home/.local/share/Trash/files



 Configuration
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  You can perform any Xfe customization (layout, file associations, key bindings, etc.) without editing any file
  by hand. However, you may want to understand the configuration principles, because some customizations can also
  easily be done by manually editing the configurations files.
  Be careful to quit Xfe before manually editing any configuration file, otherwise changes could not be taken
  into account.

  The system-wide configuration file xferc is located in /usr/share/xfe, /usr/local/share/xfe
  or /opt/local/share/xfe, in the given order of precedence. 

  Starting with version 1.32, the location of the local configuration files has changed. This is to be compliant
  with the Freedesktop standards.
  
  The local configuration files for Xfe, Xfw, Xfi, Xfp are now located in the ~/.config/xfe folder.
  They are named xferc, xfwrc, xfirc and xfprc.
  
  At the very first Xfe run, the system-wide configuration file is copied into the local configuration file
  ~/.config/xfe/xferc which does not exists yet. If the system-wide configuration file is not found
  (in case of an unusal install place), a dialog asks the user to select the right place. It is thus easier to
  customize Xfe (this is particularly true for the file associations) by hand editing because all the local options are
  located in the same file.

  Default PNG icons are located in /usr/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme or /usr/local/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme, depending
  on your installation. You can easily change the icon theme path in Preferences dialog. 
  
 
 
 Scripts
 =-=-=-=
 
  Custom shell scripts can be executed from within Xfe on the files that are selected in a panel. You have to first
  select the files you want to proceed, then right click on the file list and go to the Scripts sub menu. Last, choose
  the script you want to apply on the selected files.
  
  The script files must be located in the ~/.config/xfe/scripts folder and have to be executable. You can organize
  this folder as you like by using sub-folders. You can use the Tools / Go to script folder menu item to directly go
  to the script folder and manage it.
  
  Here is an example of a simple shell script that list each selected file on the terminal from where Xfe was launched:
  
  #!/bin/sh
  for arg
  do
  /bin/ls -la "$arg"
  done

  You can of course use programs like xmessage, zenity or kdialog to display a window with buttons that allows you to
  interact with the script. Here is a modification of the above example that uses xmessage:
  
  #!/bin/sh
  (
  echo "ls -la"
  for arg
  do
  /bin/ls -la "$arg"
  done
  ) | xmessage -file -

  Most often, it is possible to directly use Nautilus scripts found on the Internet without modifications.
   
 
 
 Search files and directories
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Xfe can quickly search files and directories by using find and grep command backends. This is done through the
  Tools / Search files menu item (or by using the Ctrl-F shortcut).
  
  In the search window, users can then specify usual search patterns like name and text, but more sophisticated search
  options are also available (size, date, permissions, users, groups, follow symlinks and empty files). Results appear
  in a file list and users can use the right click menu to manage their files, the same way as they do in the file
  panels.
  
  The search can be interrupted by clicking on the Stop button or pressing the Escape key.
 
 
 
 Non Latin based languages
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
  Xfe can display its user interface and also the file names in non latin character based languages, provided that you
  have selected a Unicode font that supports your character set. To select a suitable font, use the
  Edit / Preferences / Font menu item.
 
  Multilingual Unicode TrueType fonts can be found at this address: http://www.slovo.info/unifonts.htm
 


 Tips
 =-=-=
 
  File list
    - Select files and right click to open a context menu on the selected files
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the file panel
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to open it

  Tree list
    - Select a folder and right click to open a context menu on the selected folder
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the tree panel
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to expand it

  Copy/paste file names
    - Select a file and press Ctrl-C to copy its name into the clipboard. Then in a dialog,press Ctrl-V to paste
      the file name.
    - In a file operation dialog, select a filename in the line containing the source name and paste it directly
      to the destination using the middle button of your mouse. Then modify it to suit your needs.

  Add files to the clipboard	
    - You can select files from a directory, copy them to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C. This erases the previous
      clipboard content. Then, you can move to another directory, select other files and add them to the clipboard
      content by pressing Shift-Ctrl-C. This does not erase the previous clipboard content. At last, you can move
      to the destination and press Ctrl-V to copy all the files you have in the clipboard. Of course, this also works
      with Ctrl-X and Shift-Ctrl-X to cut and paste the files.
      
  Startup notification
    - Startup notification is the process that displays a feedback (a sandbox cursor or whatever) to the user when he
      has started an action (file copying, application launching, etc.). Depending on the system, there can be some
      issues with startup notification. If Xfe was compiled with startup notification support, the user can disable
      it for all applications at the global Preferences level. He can also disable it for individual applications,
      by using the dedicated option in the first tab of the Properties dialog. This latter way is only available
      when the file is an executable. Disabling startup notification can be useful when starting an old application
      that doesn't support the startup notification protocol (e.g. Xterm, Xpdf).

  Root mode
    - If you use the sudo root mode, it can be useful to add password feedback to the sudo command. For this purpose,
      edit your sudoers file like this:
          sudo visudo -f /etc/suoders
      and then add 'pwfeedback' to the default options, as shown below:
          Defaults         env_reset,pwfeedback
      After that, you should see stars (like *****) when you type your password in the small authentication window.


 Install from sources
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  To install Xfe in /usr/local, type (the last line must be run as root):

    ./configure
     make
     make install
  
  To install Xfe in another place, for example in /opt, type (last line as root):

    ./configure --prefix=/opt
     make
     make install

  The above installations assume that the FOX library is installed in a standard place (/usr or /usr/local). If FOX is
  installed in a non standard place, for example in /opt, then you should run (last line as root):
  
  PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/lib ./configure --prefix=/opt
  make
  make install



 Build an RPM package
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  You first need the correct fox-1.6.x and fox-devel-1.6.x packages to be installed.

  To create an RPM package from the Xfe sources, simply type:
    rpmbuild -ta Xfe-VVV.tar.gz

  where VVV is the Xfe version number (e.g. 1.35).
 
  The created RPM package Xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm is usually located in /usr/src/rpm/RPM/i386, but this
  may vary depending on your distribution and/or your customizations.
 
  To install the created RPM package Xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm, enter the following command (as root):
    rpm -Uvh Xfe-VVV-1.i386.rpm
 
 
 
 Build a Debian package
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  You first need the correct libfox1.6 and libfox1.6-dev packages to be installed.
 
  Extract the sources and enter the source folder:
    tar zxvf Xfe-VVV.tar.gz
    cd Xfe-VVV
 
  Then, build the Debian package (no need to sign the package, thus the -uc -us options):
    fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
 
  And finally, install the created package (as root):
    cd ..
    dpkg -i Xfe_VVV-1_i386.deb



 Bugs
 =-=-=
 
  Please report any found bug to Roland Baudin <roland65@free.fr>. Don't forget to mention the Xfe version you use,
  the FOX library version and your system name and version.

 
 
 Translations
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=
  
  Xfe is now available in 23 languages but some translations are only partial. To translate Xfe to your language,
  open the Xfe.pot file located in the po folder of the source tree with a software like poedit, kbabel
  or gtranslator and fill it with your translated strings (be careful to the hotkeys and c-format characters),
  and then send it back to me. I'll be pleased to integrate your work in the next Xfe release.
 
 
 
 Patches
 =-=-=-=
 
  If you have coded some interesting patch, please send it to me, I will try to include it in the next release...


 Enjoy!
 
  Many thanks to Maxim Baranov for his excellent X Win Commander and to all people that have provided useful
  patches, translations, tests and advices.
