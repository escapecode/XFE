Version 1.42 (released 27/07/2016)
- the input dialogs with history are now alphabetically sorted. The number of visible inputs is set to 8 (feature
  request #202, thanks to klappnase for his patch)
- gray / green focus icons in panels are now clickable buttons (feature request #204) 
- fixed a problem with the exec path (bug #217)
- fixed a regression where panel width percentages were incorrectly set to two digit precision. Indeed, three
  digits are required otherwise the panel widths are not correctly retained

- added custom mount / unmount commands in the Programs tab of the Preferences dialog
- fixed bugs in the Properties dialog when displaying the size and number of subfolders
- fixed a regression that prevented to refresh the panels after a file operation in the Properties dialog
- replaced the internal Xvt terminal used for root mode with st, another tiny terminal that supports UTF-8. This allows
  to fix bug #214 and to use the text font selected by the user in the Preferences dialog. As a side effect, Xft (and
  fontconfig) support is required in the FOX library. The configure.ac file was changed accordingly to reflect this new
  requirement

  two files or folders are selected
- it is now possible to open multiple Properties dialogs on different file selections
- added an optional confirmation dialog for the change property action and also added the related option to the
  Preferences dialog

- updated czsech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <arch_dvx@users.sourceforge.net>)
- fixed incorrect selection mode in XFileImage
- the menu key now has the same function as the Shift-F10 key, i.e. it opens the popup menu on a file list

  of files to open is not limited
- added setlocale() command to xvt internal terminal
- fixed a display problem in XFilePackage that occured when the package file is big
- added a new "Modes" tab to the Preferences dialog because otherwise it is too high
- added an option in the Preferences dialog to start Xfe in the home directory, in the current directory or in the last
  visited directory. Starting Xfe in given directories at the command line takes precedence over these options
- source and target size / modified time are now correctly aligned in OverwriteBox 
- avoid warning about mount points not responding when the user has no permissions on some parent directory
- replaced swriter, simpress, scalc, sdraw, sbase and smath with lowriter, loimpress, localc, lodraw, lobase and lomath,
  since LibreOffice is the default of most Linux distributions these days 
- default programs (text viewer / editor, image viewer / editor, pdf viewer, audio player, video player and archiver)
  are now identified in xferc as <txtviewer>, <txteditor>, <imgviewer>, <imgeditor>, <pdfviewer>, <audiolayer>,
  <videoplayer>, and <archiver>. Thus, when new file associations are added to the system xferc, there is no consequence
  for the user even if he has changed his default programs. Compatibility with previous version of Xfe is also ensured
  through an internal mechanism (to be removed in the future)
- fixed a bug with the overwrite confirmation dialog: in some cases, the cancel button didn't work correctly
- fixed the right panel refresh that did not occur after a file operation on it
- fixed the progress bar display when the percentage is equal to 100
- added the ability to copy or cut files from different directories and add them to the clipboard using Shift-Ctrl-C
  or Shift-Ctrl-X (by default) and to paste them all in a common place using Ctrl-V. To avoid possible problems,
  this mechanism is disabled if the user has redefined his key bindings for copy / cut and these use the Shift key
- refurbished the mechanism used to limit the length of message lines and avoid too large message windows
- updated the help and README files
- fixed the width of the Properties dialog that could be too large with long file names

- improved keyboard navigation in Xfi
- added a preference in Xfi to allow displaying the file list before the image 
- implemented vertical or horizontal stacking for image and file panel in Xfi
- implemented vertical or horizontal file panel stacking in Xfe. The directory panel is always vertical
- two floating point digits are sufficient for panel width percentages
- removed the XFileView application (Xfv) because it can be replaced with Xfw using the read only mode (xfw -r)
- added an option to start Xfw as read only (xfw --read-only, or xfw -r)

- fixed a problem when searching within folders with a lot of sub-directories and thus a long path lenght
- in the Properties dialog, the path location is now displayed on several lines if it is too long
- the maximum number of path links is reduced from 1000 to 128 because this has a strong impact on the startup time. But,
  Xfe does not crash if there are more than 128 sub-directories
- fixed the drag copy operation when the destination has the same name: we now add a (copy) suffix like with the paste
  command
- fixed a bug in File.cpp that occurred when trying to move a directory on a directory with the same name

  from the same file list or one file from the file list and another selected through a file selection dialog
- fixed the 'ftheader.h not found' problem when doing ./configure in Ubuntu 14.x and derivatives (bug #192).

  simply a checkbox to let the user select if he wants to search within hidden files or not. The status bar of the
  search panel still has the thumbnails icon
- fixed a freeze with thumbnails on and loading pipes
- fixed some file list refresh problems when thumbnails are displayed
- fixed wait cursor not displayed in file and search lists
- thumbnails are now displayed one by one in file lists. This is more user friendly than displaying them all at once

- updated the documentation by adding some clarifications about the startup notification process
- fixed an issue in configure.ac to allow compiling xfe with gcc 4.5.x

  the configure script.
- fixed a drag and drop problem between dolphin or konqueror and xfe

- fixed the double error message in xfp that was displayed when the file format is unknown. Also added a wait cursor
  that is useful when the package size is huge
- fixed a problem that occurred when testing the result of the pclose() system call, because of the harvest zombie
  mechanism which intercepts any terminated child process. This caused a bug in xfp (when opening a package)
  and xfe (when querying a package). Also fixed the query package mechanism, to be more clever when a file does not
  belong to any package
- added document icons for Scribus (sla or slc extension) 
- fixed a bug in the "open with" history, where the last item was removed whenever a command was run. Also increased
  all history sizes to 30 instead of 20.
- removed a confirmation dialog when removing / trashing a symlink on a directory
- fixed a bug when copying / moving directories to a directory with the same name(ex : /A/1/file1, /A/1/file2 to /B/1, etc.)
  This should work as expected now.

Version 1.32.1 (released 12/11/2009)
- .sh and .csh files (i.e. shell scripts) are executed when double clicking on them, if they are executable
- added support of ARJ archive format
- for extraction of rar archives, replaced the "rar x" command with "unrar x", which is more common on Linux systems
- fixed a bug that prevented to display the "+" sign correctly for some versions of the readdir() system function where
  the . and .. directories are not listed first

- updated hungarian translation (thanks to Sipos SÃ¡ndor <sipos.sandor@iconet.hu>)
- updated brazilian portuguese translation (thanks to Phantom X <megaphantomx at bol.com.br>
- fixed a potential problem in the startup_completed() function to avoid exiting Xfe when XOpenDisplay() fails.
  This situation arises in some Linux distros (Mandriva 2009, Opensuse 11, Fedora 10) when suing the root mode. I couldn't
  find the origin of the problem, which is not present on Debian Lenny, Ubuntu Jaunty, Fedora 11. 

Version 1.32 (released 19/10/2009)
- modified script sfx.sh to add uninstalling of xpm icons
- modified script makesfx.sh to add stripping of binaries
- fixed a typo in the Makefile.am that prevented man files to be installed
- added xpm icons to be compliant with the Debian Policy. Also changed the debian/menu file for the same purpose.
- fixed the size of the su button in MessageBox.cpp
- added CFLAGS configuration to configure.in
- added a mechanism to prevent zombie processes when forking
- removed the xfvt executable and integrated it in the code. This avoids a mostly unused executable into the Xfe package.

Version 1.31 (pre-release)
- fixed a segfault when viewing the Properties of an archive file
- fixed a bug that prevented the folder history list to be updated when clicking on a tree item
- fixed a bug in the folder history list : when the refresh button was clicked, the root directory was erroneously
  added to the folder history list
- updated spanish translation (thanks to FÃ©lix Medrano Sanz <xukosky@yahoo.es>)
- updated czech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com>
- updated greek trabslation (thanks to Nikos Papadopoulos <231036448@freemail.gr>)
- updated german translation (thanks to Joo Martin <ad_debian@joonet.de>)
- updated the Xfe man page to add the directory URI capability
- added a tiny terminal program xfvt (~55 KB, based on Xvt 2.1, by John Bovey) that is used in the root mode
  authentication. This allows Xfe to be independent from the terminal program installed on the system. Also used nohup
  to allow closing the terminal without destroying the Xfe window!

Version 1.30 (pre-release)
- fixed the error message displayed in root mode when the terminal program is not found 
- fixed an issue with the gvfs file system when Xfe is launched as root. For now, I choosed to disable the detection
  of this file system, but I must investigate about gvfs to understand what really causes the problem.
- fixed a problem in Makefile.am that prevented performing several 'make dist' one after the other
- fixed the file type in FileList.cpp when the file is a symbolic link that refers to a file with no association
- several fixes in Properties.cpp related to startup notification
- added a local option to the Properties dialog to disable startup notification for a given executable file
- added a global option to the Preferences dialog to disable startup notification. This only affects the way
  applications are started from within Xfe. Note that, even if the option is disabled, xfe, xfi, xfv, xfp and xfw
  still indicate they have started to the window manager (provided that xfe was not compiled with the --disable-sn
  configure option).
- added greek localization (thanks to Nikos Papadopoulos)
- fixed some typos in strings
- shell scripts can be executed again. It was not a good idea to avoid their execution in Xfe...

Version 1.29 (pre-release)
- in startup notification error reporting, we ignore errors related to X_SetInputFocus
- when a SMB mount is performed when xfe is open, the smb hard disk icon is now correctly shown

- fixed the sfx.sh.in script to correctly handle desktop files
- some changes in Makefile.am to better handle po files and other config and script files
- many changes in configure.in due to the use of intltool
- internationalization of desktop files using intltool

Version 1.28 (pre-release)
- in FilePanel, display the "Open with" dialog box when a command is not found
- added an option to disallow root mode (can be useful if xfe is deployed in a company, where root access is not allowed)
- made a conditional compilation in src/Makefile.am, relatively to the startup notification compilation option
- fixed malformed URIs when dragging files to another application. The correct form is for example file:///home/test/...
- added an option to confirm trash operations. We now distinguish trash confirmation from delete confirmation.
- fixed problems with file operation shortcuts when DirPanel is active
- fixed a serious memory leak in XFileImage
- in copy file operations, the progress window is now stretchable
- when --disable-sn is used in configure, desktop files now have StartupNotify=false
- fixed a bug in the location bar that in some cases displayed a malformed directory path instead of the correct one
- the location bar can now open directories specified as URIs, like file:///home/test
- now Xfe can open at the command line directories specified as URIs, like file:///home/test
- added the forgotten xfeutils.cpp file to POTFILES.in
- fixed a bug in positioning the xfv window (the position() function must be called *before* the FXMainWindow::create()
  function). Thanks to Joo Martin for discovering this bug.
- fixed the allowTooltip variable that was not initialized in IconList.cpp
- implemented a startup notification using version 0.9 of the libstartup-notification-1.0. Added a compilation option
  --disable-sn that allows to disable the use of the startup notification

Version 1.27 (pre-release)
- fixed a compilation problem when the FOX library is compiled without the --with-xft configure option (thanks to
  Claudio Fontana)
- updated hungarian trasnlation (thanks to Sandor Sipos)
- fixed a missing TAB in EditWindow.cpp (thanks to David Vachulka)
- updated swedish translation (thanks to Anders F Bjorklund)
- fixed some bugs in the file path sent by the Properties dialog to the chown and chmod functions 
- changed the way permissions are handled in the Properties dialog : now symbolink links are ignored when trying to change
  their permissions. However, it is possible to change their owner but the link are not followed. I also added special 
  permissions (suid, sgid and sticky) with a warning message for the user about possible unsafe behaviour.
- fixed a possible crash when the current directory contains no item (this could arise in some situations where the user
  does not have read access on the directory he is working in)
- set focus on the panels when selecting/deselcting files with Ctrl-A, Ctrl-I, etc.
- fixed a bug in Pathlinker, when navigating through directories where one name is used as the begining of an another
  name (ex: test and test1) 
- fixed a problem with truncated strings in the Properties dialog
- now the Properties dialog is displayed before that the recursive size is computed
- the wait cursor is no more useful
- updated the help.h file and the associated french translation
- added file size and modification time to the overwrite dialogs
- trashed hidden files and directories are always shown in the trash can
- updated the README and the help.h files
- when copying and moving files/folder to the trash can (at the trash base location), also create the trash info file.
- when deleting, moving or renaming files/folders from the trash can (at the trash base location), also delete the trash
  info file. But don't delete it if the file is located in a subdirectory in the trash can. 
- added a key binding for the View action (default is Shift-F4)
- changed the confirm empty directory dialog inn FilePanel to use the same ConfirmOverwrite dialog as elsewhere
- fixed a segfault in Properties.cpp when performing a chmod or a chown on a file without permissions : the file object
  was deleted too soon
- added a cancel button to the ConfirmOverwriteDialog
- fixed the progress dialog that annoyingly appeared behind dialog boxes when a file operation is interrupted
- fixed a bug when updating the file panel context menu : the rename menu was not grayed out with multiple file selection 
- fixed several memory leaks due to the use of strdup() without corresponding free() 

Version 1.26 (pre-release)
- fixed the cancel action in the Keybindings dialog : now, cancellation works as expected
- added the total number of files and number of subfolders to the Properties dialog when the selection contains directories
- changing permission or owner of a broken link is now done silently (no more annoying error message) 
- fixed the phantom trash menu when the trash can system is disabled
- fixed a problem with the wait cursor that was not displayed over the file list in some cases
- modified the trash can system to be more compliant with the Freedesktop standards. Now Xfe creates the info files where
  the original path and the deletion date are stored and displays the original path and deletion date in the file list
  and in the file tooltip.
- fixed a problem with static variables in several classes
- moving files to the trash can now creates the .trashinfo files, as required by the freedesktop standards

Version 1.25 (pre-release)
- added a Keybindings tab to the Preferences dialog that allows the user to interactively modify the key bindings 
- fixed a FOX bug in parseAccel() that prevented key bindings like Ctrl-F10 to be correctly interpreted
- added the _ICONLIST_STANDARD icon list type to distinguish between file lists, serach lists and standard lists
- fixed a bug in Preferences.cpp related to the show_mount_prev variable that was not correctly initialized.
- added the onCmdHeaderClicked callback to the IconList. This is to allow the target object to get the message
  that the user has clicked on a header button.

Version 1.24 (pre-release)
- fixed a problem when trying to create the new config directory or the new trash location if the parent folder does not
  exist. To fix this, I added the mkpath() that creates the parent directrories if necessary.
- fixed a non initialized variable (smoothscroll) in XFileImage
- fixed a crash of XFilePackage, when opening a package. Since I removed in version 1.22 the icon->create() instruction
  from icons.cpp I had to add similar instructions to the XFilePackage::create() function. This works, but I don't
  clearly understand the origin of the problem.
- changed the location of the Xfe config files and the trash can. The new locations are .config/xfe for config files
  and .local/share/Trash/files for trashed files. These are compliant with the Free Desktop standards. Note that
  at the moment, Xfe does not use the info files when trashing files.
- removed the "TRASH" string from trashed file names. This string is indeed not really necessary.
- fixed error dialog when copying files on a Windows disk and trying to preserve dates
- fixed some untranslated strings in File.cpp
- fixed the file filter history and made it retained when quitting Xfe
- added a button to the FilePanel status bar for the file filter command
- display the file filter string in red (and added this color as an attention color to the color theme)
- french translation update
- the copyright string is now in xfedefs.h
- started to work on configurable key bindings for all apps
- added a Shift-Tab keyboard shortcut to cycle through the panels in reverse order. Note it is only useful in tree and 
  two panels mode
- enabled again the keyboard shortcuts on the DirPanel because now we have a way to know which panel is active. Thus it
  is no more confusing to use shortcuts everywhere

Version 1.23 (pre-release)
- now shell scripts cannot be executed but are edited or viewed in all cases. This prevent to launch scripts by mistake.
- fixed a problem where in some cases files could have an association but no file type
- fixed a problem when navigating through the main menu using the keyboard : in one panel and tree panel modes, the 
  right panel menu appeared as a "phantom" menu. Now it's fixed. 
- fixed a problem when cancelling a drag and drop operation: the operation is now globally stopped as it should be
- avoid refreshing the directory size when when performing lenghty file operation (copy/move/delete, etc.) on a large
  number of files
- some code optimization to improve performances when xfe lists files in a big FileList
- improved xfe startup time by reducing the number of calls to FileList::listItems() to 2 instead of 6!
- added a tooltip text for the active icon of each panel
- when the path linker is not displayed (selected from the Preferences dialog), display a path text instead in every file list
- stop refreshing the file list when performing lenghty file operation on a large number of files. This prevent flickering
  and speeds up a bit the file operation
- fixed a severe performance issue when pasting a long list of files. This was because of the \r character at the end of 
  the uri strings that I removed from clipboard string to be compliant with nautilus. I completely removed the \r character
  and tested copy/paste/dnd operations with nautilus, konqueror, thunar, dolphin, krusader, rox and pcmanfm. Everything seems
  OK now.
- now Xfe tests if folders have sub-folders or not and displays the tree list accordingly

Version 1.22 (pre-release)
- all mounted file systems (including proc, sys, dev) now have the proper icon. Removeable media also have the
  file system icon and can be unmounted by the user if he has the correct permissions.
- fixed the CXXFLAGS that was unappropriately cleared before compiling
- fixed a compilation bug with gcc 4.4 (strstr now returns a constant char* instead of a char*)
- fixed the terminal command string for root mode. This string must be included within quotes for some terminals
  to work as expected
- added a Ctrl-l shortcut to clear the location bar and allow to directly enter text into the text field
- fixed a memory leak related to the run and open ComboBox history
- changed the clipboard content when copying file names from Xfe to a text application. Now, the full pathes of all the 
  selected files are pasted, as it seems to be the standard behaviour

Version 1.21 (pre-release)
- added an option to let Xfi list only known image types
- saving the window position when quitting an application is now optional. This is to be more consistent with the
  default behaviour of modern applications and window managers
- fixed the confirmation message when deleting non empty folder. Added a Yes for All button to the message box.
- replaced "foreground color" with "text color" in the Preferences dialog, because it is more informative
- fixed some focus problems on the file list when clicking on an already checked toolbar button (or activating the button
  using a shortcut)
- now in MessageBox, we can justify text and place icon as desired  
- the type-to-jump-to-filename feature now can be case insensitive, and is now coherent with the file list sort order
- in panel cycling, made the selected item always visible when focus shifts to a panel
- added desktop files to start Xfe and the related tools from the desktop menu
- added translator names to the Xfe about menu
- added a led icon to the panels that helps to distinguish which panel has the focus. Removed the old gray out
  mechanism
- fixed the file list background color, because it was wrongly obtained from the main background color 
- fixed a serious performance issue with xfv and xfw when opening large files. This was due to the isutf8()
  function which was very badly coded (shame on me)
- limited the scrollbar button size to barsize*2 instead of barsize/2
- some polish of the main windows
- customised gui control hilite and shadow colors for better looking themes
- added the rounded gradient capability (Clearlooks) to scrollbars, comboboxes, progress bars and arrow buttons

- fixed the refresh bug in the DirList, when dragging a directory at a level up
- changed the file permissions to rw when copying from a CDROM or a DVDROM (Linux only)
- fixed a FOX issue in the FileList, where in row mode the scrolling was vertically instead of horizontally
- fixed a FOX issue that prevented composed characters to be input when the mouse pointer is not within the text field
- fixed a FOX issue in FXTextField that crashed some input dialogs when FOX was compiled with the --with-xim option
- fixed a FOX issue in FXComposeContext that prevented any character to be input when FOX was compiled
  with the --with-xim option (to get support for composed characters) 
- added support for OOXML documents in xferc (thanks to Joo Martin <ad_debian@joonet.de>)
- updated german translation (thanks to Joo Martin <ad_debian@joonet.de>)
- fixed the "Jumping Jack Xfe" bug in DirPanel and PathLinker classes
- some code cleanup in FilePanel : added the dirpanel variable to the constructor to gain access to the
  DirPanel class

  without deleting the archive file
- updated czech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com>)
- updated swedish translation (thanks to Anders F BjÃ¶rklund <afb@algonet.se>)

Version 1.19.2 (released 01-08-2008)
- changed default archiver program from file-roller to xarchiver, changed default PDF viewer from acroread to xpdf,
  and changed default PS viewer from evince to gv. These new defaults are more conservative and desktop independent.

- updated japanese translation (thanks to Karl Skewes <karl@garagedori.com>) 

Version 1.19.1 (released 03-07-2008)
- when right clicking in an empty place in the directory tree, display the panel context menu
- fixed the normal color of Xfv, Xfw, Xfi and Xfp when they are started for the first time before Xfe. 
- workaround for a bug on Openbox window manager that caused Xfe and other applications to start at the first time
  with a hidden window bar. Now, we simply start at (50,50 instead of (0,0). Perhaps, an Openbox or FOX bug? 
- fixed a bug that prevented to rename a file or directory using the Properties dialog
- fixed a bug with the path linker that caused a continuous refresh of Xfe and then a high CPU usage
- added a new menu item to the file list to autosize icon names in icon view.
- DirPanel options are now persistent and are stored in the DIR PANEL section of the registry 
- fixed the shortcut of the trash menu
- removed most of the friend classes
- also added these new items to the FileDialog and to Xfi 
- added new items to the Panel menu and to the popup menu, to be able to sort on user, group, permissions and deletion
  date
- in detailed mode, fixed a problem with column darkening when sorting from the main or popup menu  
- changed all occurrences of the "filepath" variable to "pathname", to be more consistent for developments
- improved the way the FileList is periodically refreshed. Now, we don't force anymore a complete refresh every 30 seconds
  as before, except when something really changed. This allows Xfe to avoid continuously refreshing the thumbnails.
  which is prohibitive when there are large images. 
- added a FILEDIALOG section the xfe registry in replacement of the "filedialog_*" options.

Version 1.19 (released 11-06-2008)
- fixed copy/move operations when dragging files to the tree list : we don't want to change the current directory to
  the target directory (thanks to Mathis Dirksen-Thedens for this tip)
- updated swedish translation (thanks to Anders F BjÃ¶rklund <afb@algonet.se>)

Version 1.18 (released 05-06-2008)
- in FileDialog and detailed mode, we also retain the size of each column
- in Xfe, normal and text fonts can now be changed at the same time without restarting Xfe after each change
- in Xfi, Xfw, Xfv and Xfp, the OPTIONS section of the configuration files is related to the application specific local
  options. The SETTINGS section is reserved for more general options, like for example FOX options. This is more
  consistent with the convention adopted for Xfe (the main application).
- fixed a bug that prevented Xfi to retain its file list mode and its icon arangement 
- the file dialog now saves its state (size, list mode, hidden files, thumbnails, ...) between sessions and applications 
- updated japanese translation (thanks to Karl Skewes <karl@garagedori.com>) 
- fixed some typos and updated accordingly french, italian, brazilian portuguese, hungarian, czech and chinese translations
  (thanks to Claudio Fontana <claudio@gnu.org> for discovering these typos)

Version 1.17 (pre-release)
- added the rounded gradient capability to toggle buttons
- fixed the problem of GUI updating : now the GUI is only updated when the user interacts with the program.
  This significantly saves some CPU.
- fixed the path link when hovering over a directory in the file or directory list
- added support for extracting ACE archives (the unace program must be present on the system)
- fixed some bugs related to the path linker
- updated brazilian portuguese translation (thanks to Phantom X <megaphantomx@bol.com.br>)
- added support for extracting ace archives
- fixed the color of the engaged buttons when using the rounded gradient controls
- in the archive dialog, now typing an archive extension automatically sets the correct archive format 
- added the new path linker to the file dialog and to the file list of Xfi. Removed the old DirBox from the file dialog.

Version 1.16 (pre-release)
- updated czech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com>)
- fixed the search and replace dialogs in Xfw, because there was problems with the rounded gradient theme
- completely revamped the pathlinker feature. Now we display links as real buttons and we can go anywhere through the
  visited path. Also fixed the problem of the right most button used for Panel focus 
- updated chinese translation (thanks to li xin <xinliGG@gmail.com>)
- updated italian translation (thanks to Claudio Fontana <cladio@gnu.org>)

Version 1.15 (pre-release)
- updated hungarian translation (thanks to SÃ¡ndor Sipos <ss1978@freestart.hu>)
- updated brazilian portuguese translation (thanks to Phantom X <megaphantomx@bol.com.br>)
- fixed a crash bug that occurred when toggling the thumbnails button and moving to another directory
- fixed the gradient button background color when the background color is not the base color

Version 1.14 (pre-release)
- updated brazilian portuguese translation (thanks to Phantom X <megaphantomx@bol.com.br>)
- fixed a big memory leak when displaying thumbnails in the FileList : the X11 pixmap memory was not correctly freed
- changed a bit the way the registry directories and files are managed. However, it should be transparent for the end user.
  The vendor key is not used anymore in the registry but it is still used during the application creation to set the WM_CLASS
  window property.
- fixed the background color of the line and column numbers in xfv 
- added the TextLabel widget, based on FXTextField. This allows to have a different widget for the file operation dialogs

Version 1.13 (pre-release)
- added a rounded rectangle capability to FXTextField 
- added the FOX color theme to the Preferences dialog
- FOX hack to optionally display all buttons with a nice gradient effect and rounded corners (thanks to Sander Jansen
 <sander@knology.net> for the related code)

Version 1.12 (pre-release)
- improved the way the FilePanel popup dialog is displayed when using the Shift-F10 keyboard shorcut
- added an option to display or hide the FilePanel path linker
- we now use the .cpp extension for the source files, instead of .cc . This is to be consistent with the FOX library.
- xterm is no more required for the root mode. Now, if xterm is not present on the system, we use the terminal program 
  that is specified in the Preferences dialog. However, xterm is still the default and the user's terminal is only used
  as a fallback. This is because xterm has many options that can be used to nicely format the user dialog.
- updated chinese translation (thanks to xinli <xinliGG@gmail.com>)
- fixed a small problem in file operation dialogs with the size of the command message. Now, we adjust the message size
  by taking into account the real font size.
- fixed a regression in FileDialog where the ICONLIST_AUTOSIZE directive was ignored
- in file dialogs , fixed foreground, background and highlight colors in detailed mode
- compiling in debug mode does not set the -O2 flag
- additional review of the french translation. Fixed some issues. 
- added new selectable default programs in the Preferences dialog : PDF, audio and video viewers
- removed the wheel lines option in Xfw. It is indeed redundant with the same option in Xfe
- fixed the smooth scrolling and wheel lines options in Xfp, Xfv, Xfw and Xfi
- fixed a small bug in XFilePackage where the window size was not saved after clicking on the close button
- in the xferc config file, the OPTIONS section is now reserved to xfe specific options. Other options that
  are common to all four applications are now saved under the SETTINGS section of xferc. Nothing changed in
  other config files. Note : when reading the xfe registry from Xfv and others, generic FOX options like wheellines,
  selbackcolor, etc., are automatically read from the xferc config file. Specific options like single_click, file_tooltips,
  etc., must be read explicitely.  
- file dialogs now retain their size, mode and also the hidden files and thumbnails state
- work done to have a better consistency between file dialogs and file operations (concerning the file/folder
  selection mode)

Version 1.11 (pre-release)
- fixed a problem when resizing the size column (the right justified one) in detailed mode
- implemented optional relative resizing of panels and columns in file list detailed mode
- added japanese translation (thanks to Karl Skewes <karl@garagedori.com>)

Version 1.10 (pre-release)

  Thanks to Karl Skewes <karl@garagedori.com> who discovered these bugs.
- fixed problem when renaming the last file of a list to a different directory 
- fixed problem when renaming a file or folder located on a mounted volume

- fixed a bug that occured when resizing the panels using the splitter
- added the reverse order menu item to the main Panel menu. This one was missing for some obscure reason. 
- updated hungarian translation (thanks to SÃ¡ndor Sipos <ss1978@freestart.hu>)
- in FilePanel, don't select the first item (the parent directory) with select all or select inverse
- for consistency purpose, also added a similar panel context menu to the DirPanel. 
- in FilePanel, the panel context menu item is now a submenu. It should be more usable like this.
- new complete KDE icon theme
- new partial tango icon theme
- new partial XFCE icon theme

Version 1.09 (pre-release)
- fixed a bug that prevented dragging files from Xfe to the ROX filer or desktop
- fixed a bug that prevented unmounting removable file systems after executing some copy/move/extract/etc. function
  in Xfe (this was related to the chdir performed before some operations)
- in FilePanel, the starting directory of the extract to command is now set to the home directory
- added an option to avoid displaying tooltips in the FileList or DirList 
- display again some information in the status bar when only one file is selected. This useful when navigating using the keyboard
- allowed again file names without extension to have their icon (there is still a problem with file names like zip or cc,
  but I have no solution for them at the moment)
- allowed again empty file names in FileDialog (why did I remove this feature in version 1.07?)
- fixed a bug when dragging files to the FilePanel : the Pathlinker was not refreshed correctly
- fixed a bug when copying/pasting/renaming/symlinking or dragging a directory in the DirList :
  now we correctly display the target directory 

Version 1.08 (pre-release)
- added a patch from Tomas Kolousek <kolousek@spscv.cz> that adds an option to force a panel mode from the command line.
  Thanks Tomas!
- added stuff in configure.in to handle the problem of the Xft support in FOX library. One can now compile
  Xfe even if FOX has been compiled without Xft support
- fixed a problem when working with filenames that contain characters like ' " $ \ etc.
  (thanks to Glynn Clements <glynnc@users.sourceforge.net>)
- fixed a bug with single click in the FileList when horizontally scrolling the list
- disabled the focus file list and dir list refresh mecanism introduced in version 1.06 : it has serious refresh problems
  when the listed files are modified and xfe has not the focus

Version 1.07 (pre-release)
- fixed a pointer problem in the function isEmptyDir() of File.cc (thanks to Tobias Ulmer)
- single click file and directory open options are now completely independant
- added a new panel context menu item that allows to open the panel context menu. The old control right click
  way is still there.

- added error dialogs when nothing is entered in an operation dialog
- fixed problems with some error dialogs when errno is not set

  class, thanks to Alain Ducasse for the tip)

Version 1.06 (pre-release)
- when sorting files in the FileList, if option Directories first is checked, then directories are always
  displayed on top of the list. This seems indeed more convenient.
- modified browse input dialog to distinguish between the cases of single and multiple files selections
- added a menu item to create a new symbolic link refering an existing file or directory
- added an option to set the smooth scrolling on/off in the Preferences dialog. This is only valid for file lists.
- added two menu items in the Tools section : one for synchronizing the two panels (i.e. being at the same
  directory in both panels) and the other for switching directories between panels
- fixed a bug in the main Makefile.am that prevented 'make distclean' to work properly
- limited the size of the file operation dialog messages when long file names are used
- fixed a bug in the Preferences / Programs dialog where the archiver browse dialog was wrongly related to
  the image viewer
- fixed problems with the progress dialog and the error dialogs in file copy/move operations
- added an error message in xfi when trying to load a corrupted image file
- fixed a crash bug in xfi that occurred when clicking on a non image file after a valid image file had been loaded

- updated again german translation (thanks to Joo Martin <debian@joomart.de>)
- replaced file names double quoting with single quoting

- do a better refresh of the file list : when xfe has not the focus, we don't perform a complete refresh of the file list,
  but only a refresh when files or directories have changed. This should save some CPU. (Note: removed later in version 1.08)

Version 1.05 (pre-release)
- fixed compilation warnings with gcc 4.2 related to string constants
- updated german translation (thanks to Joo Martin <debian@joomart.de>)

  and DirPanel.cc
- updated Chinese translation, thanks to Li Xin <xinliGG@gmail.com>
- added the deletion date to the TreeList tooltip, when the directory under mouse is in trash can
- changed the way root directory sizes for TreeList and IconList tooltips are computed : the performances
  should be much better now
- removed the Save Settings menu of Xfi because settings are now automatically saved 
- when cancel is pressed in the More Preferences dialog of Xfi, all options are now reset to the previous values
- when cancel is pressed in the Preferences dialog of Xfe, all options are now reset to the previous values

Version 1.03 (pre-release)
- fixed some strings displayed when selecting icon or program files
- updated the README and help.h files
- fixed the selection of the icons theme directory in the Preferences dialog
- fixed a small regression when selecting directories in FileDialog in Copy to, Move to, Rename, etc.
- some cosmetics in the Theme tab of the Preferences dialog
- changed the default icon theme to gnomeblue and also changed the default base color to something lighter
- icons files that are the same between different themes are now handled using symbolic links. This avoids wasting
  disk space and is more easy to maintain in the source tree

Version 1.02 (pre-release)
- improved the way a directory is selected in FileDialog : in an empty directory, if we hit OK then we get the current
  directory instead of doing nothing
- fixed a crash bug in XFileImage, because the numsortheader variable was not initialized in IconList
- when using the directory back, forward and up commands, the focus is keeped on the current tree or file panel

  is over the name column
- added an option to confirm the deletion of empty directories
- fixed a crash bug when moving the last file of a panel to another place

- now the size and sort function of the file list columns in XFileImage are saved between sessions
- fixed some typos in the french translation (accents)
- added an icon to each non modal window
- fixed a typo in the french translation

- adjusted the makesfx.sh and sfx.sh scripts to reflect the rename of Xfq and to allow uninstalling the FOX libraries 
- fixed a bug that prevented the use of the open command on multiple files
- added Chinese translation, thanks to Li Xin <xinliGG@gmail.com>

Version 0.99.8 (pre release)
- fixed a problem with the CommandWindow when executing a command that return nothing
- updated help and readme files
- changed the way that icon themes are selected. This should be more intuitive now.
- added a new "Extract to folder" menu for archive extraction
- fixed a crash bug that occurred when displaying properties of a mount point on a crypted filesystem
- renamed XFileQuery to XFilePackage (which is more appropriate) anq Xfq to Xfp
- simplification of the bookmarks menu code in XFileExplorer
- fixed a regression in the Preference dialog, where some options that need restart were no more retained
- synchronized file associations between different Xfe instances. However, for icons to be immediately updated
  it is necessary to click on the toolbar refresh button.

Version 0.99.7 (pre release)
- fixed several bugs in PathLinker that prevented correct display of the path buttons in some cases
- synchronized bookmarks between different Xfe instances
- fixed a small bug in DialogBox, where hitting the return key didn't activate the OK button
- added Ctrl-W hotkey to each app. This shortcut closes the window. Replaced the Ctrl-W (Zoom to fit Window) in Xfi with
  Ctrl-F.
- removed the quit buttons in each app. I think it's not necessary.
- fixed a bug in the FilePanel : when using the "open with" command, at the second time the wait cursor was always open
- fixed drag and drop when dragging into directories in Xfe : the directory where we are dragging from is now displayed after
  the drag menu appears
- added copy/paste scheme to the search / replace dialogs in Xfw. Fixed a bug in the search for selected text menu items
- major Xfe code reorganisation : now the file management routines are located in the FilePanel and DirPanel classes.
  Toolbar buttons and main menu items are now relative to the file panels only. The directory panel only uses
  the right click popup menu for his file operations. This is more consistent whith the way other file managers
  operate.  

Version 0.99.6 (pre release)
- added a file browse icon to the open with and execute command dialogs
- better consistency in the FilePanel status
- added more informations to the tooltip displayed when hovering on an item in the FileList
- now, when nothing is selected in the file panels, the delete menus, buttons and keys are disabled. However, the
  user can still delete a directory in the tree panel by using the right click menu. This avoids possible manipulation
  errors when using the delete keys.
- translation of the help dialog to french, thanks to Claude Leo Mercier for his help (<claude.leo.mercier@gmail.com>)
- split of the main toolbar in two smaller ones. This allows to better display toolbars on a small screen.

- fixed a crash bug in the help dialog
- added an option in PreferencesBox to adjust the mouse scrolling speed and redesigned the Preferences tabs
- toolbars can now be docked on each side of the window

  browsing using the keyboard. Thanks to hudsucker <hudsucker@users.sourceforge.net> for the patch.
- added a context menu to the FileList in XFileImage
- added the ability to copy/paste text between most dialogs in all applications

Version 0.99.5 (pre release)
- added swedish translation (Anders BjÃ¶rklund <afb@users.sourceforge.net>)
- added the ability to copy/paste file names between the FileList (or DirList) and dialogs.
  I have chosen to only keep the first file name of the clipboard contents.
- in root mode, obtain the correct background and foreground xterm colors
- I realized that the directory size in detail panel mode is not useful, so I removed it

Version 0.99.4 (pre release)
- added the ability to use sudo instead of su for the root mode. This allows Ubuntu users to use the root mode, and
  sudo is more versatile than su.
- FOX hack to display non UTF-8 file names (e.g. 8 bits) correctly. A warning message is displayed in file dialogs
  when the file name is not in UTF-8. It is possible to copy/move/rename files with non UTF-8 file names but string
  manipulation into the text field is ugly. This is due to the fact that FOX 1.6.x don't directly support anymore
  8 bits strings.  

Version 0.99.3 (pre release)
- fixed a problem when testing if the distribution used in Debian based. I tested the presence of "apt-get" but
  it seems more appropriate to test the existence of "dpkg" on the system
- fixed a bug in xfv : the position and size of the window were not saved when closing the program using the
  cross icon on the window
- replaced the create archive dialog with a (hopefully) more intuitive one
- replaced the DirlistBox with a FileDialog (more powerful) when extracting archives
- added the ability to browse files for selecting destination in file operations
- now supports symlink on a multiple selection

Version 0.99.2 (pre release)
- added the ability to click on the panel title to set the focus on it
- fixed an issue when opening a new Xfe window : the starting directory was not always the home directory
  as it should be
- added clipboard support to Xfe : we can now copy/cut/paste from and to Nautilus (Gnome Desktop), Konqueror
  (KDE desktop) and Thunar (XFCE desktop). Copying and pasting from and to any file manager that uses the standard
  text/uri-list type should also work.

Version 0.99.1 (pre release)
- fixed a problem with Matlab file icons in xferc.in
- updated and fixed the french translation
- reintroduced the filter indication in FilePanel. It was lost since the introduction of the path link widget.

- the registry was not updated in some cases in the Preferences dialog
- changed the cursor to a hand when browsing using a single click
- added options to allow single click file and directory open in FilePanel, FileDialog and XFileImage
- file copy operations now keep the original date of the input files or directory (although it is not the default in the Unix /bin/cp
  command, it is the default in many file managers, and it is more useful from the user point of view)
- fixed a crash bug when creating a link to the / directory
- fixed typos in cleanPath() and filePath()
- fixed a small typo in Preferences.h
- fixed a bug that prevented settings to be retained on Mac OS X (and other systems?)
- updated czech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com>)
- updated deutsch translation (thanks to Joo Martin <debian@joomart.de>)

Version 0.98.2 (released 20-02-2007)
- added stuff to create a self extracting package. The user can type sh xfe-0.99-i386.sh to install Xfe to /usr/local
- added a Windows icon theme
- converted ru.po to UTF-8
- fixed a crash bug whith the FileDialog when associating a program to a file (the StringList pointers were not
  defined because setDirectory() was not called)
- fixed a bug with the progress bar when copying files of size > 4GB. The percentage was not correctly displayed.
- removed the statout() and lstatout() functions that were too slow on a computer with a lot of NFS or Samba mount
  points. They are replaced by statrep() and lstatrep() that are faster.
  The timeout for down mount points is now 30 seconds (this is the default timeout of stat() and lstat() on Linux systems),
  and the mtab is checked every 5 seconds. Up and down mount points are now refreshed every 5 minutes.
  This change should make Xfe more responsive in the general case, but less reponsive when some mount points are not
  respondind. This is the tradeoff...
- replaced exit() by _exit() in every fork child

Version 0.98.1 (released 13-02-2007)
- I realized that xfe could not be installed by a non root user because of the /etc/xfe/xferc configuration file
  location. So I decided to move this file to $prefix/share/xfe/xferc which can easily be customized by a user
  that wants to install xfe in a non system place.
- fixed a bug in pkgInstall() that prevented packages to be installed when xfe is started from a directory which
  is not the same as the package directory
- converted most of po files to UTF-8
- avoid zombies by using system() instead of execl() in the runcmd() function
- added the forgotten pclose() in main.cc and XFileQuery.cc that produced a sh zombie
- fixed a bug with diacritic symbols when the locale is not set to UTF-8 (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com
  for the tip)
- fixed a serious bug that occurred when copying files on a location where some of these files already exist : no error
  message must be displayed in this case and the copy operation must not stop! 
- fixed a serious crash bug when link directories have trailing '/' in their name
- fixed some mistakes in the README and help.cc files

- fixed a bug with FXTextField when displaying the InputDialog : now the dialog should have the correct width.
- changed the way the open command is handled. Now multiple files having the same association are handled simultaneously.
  It thus should be easier to queue files in xmms, for example.

  This is to use our statout() and lstatout() functions with timeout on Linux systems.
- added or updated the following translations : pt_PT (Miguel Santinho), de (Tim Benke),
  es (MartÃ­n Carr), hu (SZERVAC Attila). Thanks to these people!
- now uses the identical() function to test if source is identical to target. This allows
