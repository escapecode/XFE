 some key actions are hardcoded an cannot be changed. These include:\n \
\n \
    * Ctrl-+ and Ctrl--                 - zoom in and zoom out image in Xfi\n \

    * Esc                               - close current dialog, unselect files, etc.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Drag and Drop operations\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Dragging a file or group or files (by moving the mouse while maintaining the left button pressed)\n \
 to a folder or a file panel optionally opens a dialog that allows one to select the file operation: copy,\n \
 move, link or cancel.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Trash system\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Starting with version 1.32, Xfe implements a trash system that is fully compliant with the freedesktop.org standards.\n \
 This allows the user to move files to the trash can and to restore files from within Xfe or your favorite\n \
 desktop.\n \
 Note that the trash files location is now: ~/.local/share/Trash/files\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Configuration\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 You can perform any Xfe customization (layout, file associations, key bindings, etc.) without editing any file\n \
 by hand. However, you may want to understand the configuration principles, because some customizations can also\n \
 easily be done by manually editing the configurations files.\n \
 Be careful to quit Xfe before manually editing any configuration file, otherwise changes could not be taken\n \
 into account.\n \
\n \
 The system-wide configuration file xferc is located in /usr/share/xfe, /usr/local/share/xfe\n \
 or /opt/local/share/xfe, in the given order of precedence.\n \
\n \
 Starting with version 1.32, the location of the local configuration files has changed. This is to be compliant\n \
 with the freedesktop.org standards.\n \
 \n \
 The local configuration files for Xfe, Xfw, Xfi, Xfp are now located in the ~/.config/xfe folder.\n \
 They are named xferc, xfwrc, xfirc and xfprc.\n \
 \n \
 At the very first Xfe run, the system-wide configuration file is copied into the local configuration file\n \
 ~/.config/xfe/xferc which does not exists yet. If the system-wide configuration file is not found\n \
 (in case of an unusal install place), a dialog asks the user to select the right place. It is thus easier to\n \
 customize Xfe (this is particularly true for the file associations) by hand editing because all the local options are\n \
 located in the same file.\n \
\n \
 Default PNG icons are located in /usr/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme or /usr/local/share/xfe/icons/xfe-theme, depending\n \
 on your installation. You can easily change the icon theme path in Preferences dialog.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Scripts\n \
  =-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Custom shell scripts can be executed from within Xfe on the files that are selected in a panel. You have to first\n \
 select the files you want to proceed, then right click on the file list and go to the Scripts sub menu. Last, choose\n \
 the script you want to apply on the selected files.\n \
\n \
 The script files must be located in the ~/.config/xfe/scripts folder and have to be executable. You can organize\n \
 this folder as you like by using sub-folders. You can use the Tools / Go to script folder menu item to directly go\n \
 to the script folder and manage it.\n \
\n \
 Here is an example of a simple shell script that list each selected file on the terminal from where Xfe was launched:\n \
\n \
 #!/bin/sh\n \
 for arg\n \
 do\n \
 /bin/ls -la \"$arg\"\n \
 done\n \
\n \
 You can of course use programs like xmessage, zenity or kdialog to display a window with buttons that allows you to\n \
 interact with the script. Here is a modification of the above example that uses xmessage:\n \
\n \
 #!/bin/sh\n \
 (\n \
 echo  \"ls -la\"\n \
 for arg\n \
 do\n \
 /bin/ls -la \"$arg\"\n \
 done\n \
 ) | xmessage -file -\n \
\n \
 Most often, it is possible to directly use Nautilus scripts found on the Internet without modifications.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
 Search files and directories\n \
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
\n \
 Xfe can quickly search files and directories by using find and grep command backends. This is done through the\n \
 Tools / Search files menu item (or by using the Ctrl-F shortcut).\n \
\n \
 In the search window, users can then specify usual search patterns like name and text, but more sophisticated search\n \
 options are also available (size, date, permissions, users, groups, follow symlinks and empty files). Results appear\n \
 in a file list and users can use the right click menu to manage their files, the same way as they do in the file\n \
 panels.\n \
\n \
 The search can be interrupted by clicking on the Stop button or pressing the Escape key.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Non Latin based languages\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 Xfe can display its user interface and also the file names in non latin character based languages, provided that you\n \
 have selected a Unicode font that supports your character set. To select a suitable font, use the\n \
 Edit / Preferences / Font menu item.\n \
\n \
 Multilingual Unicode TrueType fonts can be found at this address: http://www.slovo.info/unifonts.htm\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Tips\n \
  =-=-=\n \
\n \
 File list\n \
    - Select files and right click to open a context menu on the selected files\n \
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the file panel\n \
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to open it\n \
\n \
 Tree list\n \
    - Select a folder and right click to open a context menu on the selected folder\n \
    - Press Ctrl + right click to open a context menu on the tree panel\n \
    - When dragging a file/folder to a folder, hold on the mouse on the folder to expand it\n \
\n \
 Copy/paste file names\n \
    - Select a file and press Ctrl-C to copy its name into the clipboard. Then in a dialog,press Ctrl-V to paste\n \
      the file name.\n \
    - In a file operation dialog, select a filename in the line containing the source name and paste it directly\n \
      to the destination using the middle button of your mouse. Then modify it to suit your needs.\n \
\n \
 Add files to the clipboard\n \
    - You can select files from a directory, copy them to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C. This erases the previous\n \
      clipboard content. Then, you can move to another directory, select other files and add them to the clipboard\n \
      content by pressing Shift-Ctrl-C. This does not erase the previous clipboard content. At last, you can move\n \
      to the destination and press Ctrl-V to copy all the files you have in the clipboard. Of course, this also works\n \
      with Ctrl-X and Shift-Ctrl-X to cut and paste the files.\n \
\n \
 Startup notification\n \
    - Startup notification is the process that displays a feedback (a sandbox cursor or whatever) to the user when\n \
      he has started an action (file copying, application launching, etc.). Depending on the system, there can be\n \
      some issues with startup notification. If Xfe was compiled with startup notification support, the user can\n \
      disable it for all applications at the global Preferences level. He can also disable it for individual\n \
      applications, by using the dedicated option in the first tab of the Properties dialog. This latter way is\n \
      only available when the file is an executable. Disabling startup notification can be useful when starting\n \
      an old application that doesn't support the startup notification protocol (e.g. Xterm).\n \
\n \
  Root mode\n \
    - If you use the sudo root mode, it can be useful to add password feedback to the sudo command. For this purpose,\n \
      edit your sudoers file like this:\n \
          sudo visudo -f /etc/suoders\n \
      and then add 'pwfeedback' to the default options, as shown below:\n \
          Defaults         env_reset,pwfeedback\n \
      After that, you should see stars (like *****) when you type your password in the small authentication window.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Bugs\n \
  =-=-=\n \
\n \
 Please report any found bug to Roland Baudin <roland65@free.fr>. Don't forget to mention the Xfe version you use,\n \
 the FOX library version and your system name and version.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Translations\n \
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=\n \
 \n \
 Xfe is now available in 23 languages but some translations are only partial. To translate Xfe to your language,\n \
 open the Xfe.pot file located in the po folder of the source tree with a software like poedit, kbabel\n \
 or gtranslator and fill it with your translated strings (be careful to the hotkeys and c-format characters),\n \
 and then send it back to me. I'll be pleased to integrate your work in the next Xfe release.\n \
\n \
\n \
\n \
  Patches\n \
  =-=-=-=\n \
\n \
 If you have coded some interesting patch, please send it to me, I will try to include it in the next release...\n \
\n \
\n \
 Many thanks to Maxim Baranov for his excellent X Win Commander and to all people that have provided useful\n \
 patches, translations, tests and advices.\n \
