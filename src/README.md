**XFE** X File Explorer (Xfe) is an MS-Explorer like file manager for X. It is based on the popular, but discontinued, X Win Commander, which was developed by Maxim Baranov.
Xfe aims to be the filemanager of choice for all the Unix addicts!

### Features
* File Manager
* Image viewer
* Text editor
* Package manager

Valuable note:  This GitHub repository is noot the de facto location for XFE source code.  This repository was created since there was no revision control system on Source Forge. The benefits of an online revision control system, such as what is availaable on GitHub is self explanatory.  Hence this repository was created.
Grab the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/escapecode/XFE/releases/latest).
