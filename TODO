TODO list and known issues
--------------------------


Known issues
------------


- to allow composed characters (like ä, Ö, ê, etc.) to be entered in xfe, xfw, etc., the FOX library *must* be
  compiled with the --with-xim configure option.
- if the mouse pointer is on a menu title, then it is not possible to navigate using the keyboard on the menu titles.
  This is a FOX issue.
- in Xfw, if the wordwrap mode is selected an line numbers are displayed, then the line numbers are uncorrectly
  displayed for wrapped lines. This is also a FOX issue.



To do
------


- add the ability to delete bookmarks and change their order
- add a way to change order and display of columns in detailed mode
- places (home + trash + mtab entries) and bookmark items could be displayed as a tab pane in the tree panel
- use of MIME types in complement to file associations
- use a Control Panel style for the Preferences dialog
- implement lenghty operations in background (image thumbnails, copy...)
- add context options (copy / paste / delete) to the location bar, like in Firefox
- add a way to clean history lists (like the open file list, for example)
- internationalization should handle multiple plural forms (required by languages like polish, czech, etc.)


User requests
